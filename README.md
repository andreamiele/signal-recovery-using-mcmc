# MCMC Signal Recovery Project

Welcome to the MCMC Signal Recovery Project! This repository contains all the necessary information and code to understand and implement signal recovery using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to recover a signal from noisy observations using MCMC techniques. We explore different scenarios and optimization problems to estimate the unknown vector \( \theta \) given observations \( (X, y) \).

This project is part of the **Markov Chains and Algorithmic Applications** course (COM-516) at EPFL, Fall 2023, worth 6 ECTS credits.

## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **MH_SA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Simulated Annealing for signal recovery.
- **MCAA_Project_Qns_description.pdf**: Project description
- **Markov_chains_miniproject.pdf**: Report detailing the project, including methodology, results, and analysis.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcmc-signal-recovery.git
   cd signal-recovery-using-mcmc
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `MH_SA.ipynb` to execute the code for signal recovery using MCMC techniques:

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `MH_SA.ipynb` and run the cells to see the implementation and results of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and Simulated Annealing for different signal recovery scenarios.

### Viewing the Report
